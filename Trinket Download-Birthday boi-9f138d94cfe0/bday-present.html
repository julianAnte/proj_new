      <p><strong>HAI, IANNIM! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DUDE. 😾</strong></p>
      <p>Hindi ka na younger. 🙄</p>
      <p>
        Seriously though, thank you for being one of the realest people in my
        life. Kahit bastos ka minsan (😔✌️), I’m still super grateful to have
        you. You're that one person na I can be weird with, honest with, and
        still feel safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sana you grow more. And I wish na in that growth, I’ll be there.
        Cheering for you, kasi puwede.
      </p>
      <p>
        I pray na you learn to prioritize yourself first before anyone else.
        ‘Wag mo 'ko gayahin na 'laging second option lang HAUSHAHAHA, joke.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish I could help you the same way you helped me. You're such a
        genuinely kind person, cuh. Please don’t lose that. The world needs more
        people like you. And I'll do the same for you too.
      </p>
          
      <p>
        Anyway, sana dumami pa birthdays mo, as well as your kuwentos and
        helpful advices. Very happy to have a friend like you,
        <strong>AND sana manlibre ka ulit ng matcha 😛🫶</strong>
      </p>
