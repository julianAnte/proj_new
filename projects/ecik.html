          Today, i feel like i did something wrong kaya i wanna apologize po
          kasi it seems na ur upset too :<, i saw a blank expression from you,
          and a not good one too, and i wondered if there was something wrong,
          but it was also wrong of me to not check up on you po, for that i'm
          sorry. i remembered our talk a few days ago, and i believe na i'm
          doing something wrong po, for that, i'm sorry.
          <br />
          <br />
          i feel like i'm breaking you nanaman kasi i'm being kinda avoidant
          around you, pero, i'm js scared of acey rn and scared kasi andyan yung
          iba, i wanna do better po next time, babawi ako. i'm sorry because you
          already had a lot of confusion with regards to me and my promises, and
          i think i'm js adding more fuel to the fire.
          <br />
          <br />
          i'm sorry for burning myself out today, i'm sorry i played, i'm sorry
          if i felt away, i js don't know how to approach you yet po. pero i
          hope i figure it out in time.
          <br />
          <br />
          i wanna change, i wanna do better, not just for myself, but for
          you.<br />
          <br />
          i want you to feel better and be comforted better, i want you to be
          certain through what i do, but i'm failing to do that. i know na i'm
          doing something wrong po.
          <br />
          <br />
          i don't wanna promise, but i'll still strive for it, i'll still work
          hard for it; the promises i kept, and the acts i'm doing now. i'm
          sorry po, if you feel sad, bothered, dissapointed, and uncertain with
          me, not just from today.
          <br />
          <br />
          you deserve better, and i wanna give you that better. i'm working
          myself off po para you'll get what you deserve, love, care, respect,
          certainty, assurance, transparancy, and validity. i know na you
          deserve all of those, and i wanna be the one who gives them to you.
          i'm sorry if i failed to day, and yesterday; pero i hope na it'll be
          the last times i fail in pursuit of better.
          <br />
          <br />
          i'm sorry hanna, i'm deeply sorry, please forgive me
          <br />
          <br />
